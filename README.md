Color Combination Code Challenge

I assumed that the combination 1)blue yellow 2) yellow red 3)red black 4) black green in any order can unlock the system.

Once the apk is installed , the launch screen has multiple option dailog, where one can select different color combinations. I used activity and fragements.

I used junit matchers depenedencies for the unite test cases.There are three unit test cases 1) Random input 2) incorrect unit 3) Correct input.
